Home Work

1.  Wrap the avatar in the Header in a TouchableOpacity, if it is clicked it should change the screen to Profile (ie make the profile tab go blue)

2.  Create a class component called Music.js.  It should be flex 1 and white.  Import it into Navigator.js and in the JSX replace the About component with the Music component.

3.  Open the github page and copy the file './src/data/musicData' into your project

4.  Import musicData into the Music component and console.log it to see if it is imported properly

5.  Change the console.log to log the first item in the musicData array instead of the entire array

6.  Create a new functional component called Song.js and import it into Music.js

7.  Song should take 2 props title and artist and it should display them in a bordered box.

8. Music should send title and artist of the FIRST song in the array to the Song component.  

9. Wrap song in a Touchable Opacity and when its clicked it should say 'I was clicked!'

10.  Bonus!  When Song is pressed it should open the youtube link
