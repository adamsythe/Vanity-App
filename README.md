You need to create a custom component called About.js and import it into Navigator.js (replacing the middle View).

The About component should have two text fields, one a header (your name will do) and below that a little description about you.  

You may want to horizontal center everything inside the component.  

You will need a little bit of margin between the top of the component and each text field try and find margin (or marginTop) inside the docs under api - view layout props

You also may want to style the textfields, especially fontSize.  

Try find fontsize inside the docs under api - text style props
