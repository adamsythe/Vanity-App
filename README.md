Home Work

1.
Make the About component white
Make the Footer and Header component white
Give the Footer a borderTop
Give the Header a borderBottom
Look at the docs and check out shadowProps, they go inside styles. Both the footer and header should have a shadow

2.  On the About component make the Avatar bigger
	Add some margin to the description text to make it look a little nicer
	Add a smaller avatar to the Header, dont stress about where on the Header it sits but it must be smaller than the About one

3. Read up about the react-native component about TouchableOpacity. Please wrap the tabs in this component as well as the avatar in the header.  Leave out the onPress prop for now. 

4.  (this one is difficult). Add the onPress prop to your Touchable Opacities, when they get pressed i wont to see 'I was pressed!' in the console.
