new things!!!

1.  Try get your Song component looking really good

2.  Read up about the react-native component flatlist and try incorprate it to create a list of all the songs

3. Read up about the react native component TextInput and put it on the Music component above the list of songs

4.  Bonus!  Have a look at how if statements and using triple equals try and see if you can get the screen to switch when you click the tabs.  When its on Profile it should show the About screen, when its on Music it should show the music screen and if its neither of those it should have a view with flex 1.  This is very challenging so gl!
